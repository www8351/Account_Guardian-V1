//| Authority order, and why it is not the obvious one. Broker deal  |
//| history is the AUTHORITY because it is server-side and a local-  |
//| machine attacker cannot forge or delete it. The file and the GV  |
//| live entirely on this machine and are locally writable, so they  |

//| Returns 0 = no lock, 1 = lock, 2 = NOT EVALUABLE. The third is   |
//| the F6 obligation and is why this is not a bool: a failed        |
//| HistorySelect must never be read as "no deals, therefore no      |
//| breach", so it blocks the SYNCING exit for another pass instead  |
