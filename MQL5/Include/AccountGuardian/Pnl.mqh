//| Single fold over the whitelisted deals since the anchor,         |
//| returning BOTH the realized sum and the running minimum of the   |
//| cumulative realized. AgRealized and the derived lock witness are |
//| the two callers, so the F12 whitelist and the Q3 per-deal        |
//| formula exist once here and cannot drift between them, which is  |
//| the whole reason this is a shared helper rather than a second    |
//| loop written beside the first.                                   |
//|                                                                  |
//| running_min is M_n from design item 3: M_0 = 0 and               |
//| M_k = min(M_{k-1}, R_k), monotonically non-increasing. Once the  |
//| cumulative dips below -limit it STAYS below, no matter what      |
//| later deals do to the final total. That is what makes a realized |
//| loss survive a recovery: a check on current PnL alone sees the   |
//| recovered total and no breach, while the running minimum still   |
//| carries the dip.                                                 |
//|                                                                  |
//| ORDER MATTERS HERE AND ONLY HERE. A sum is order-independent, a  |
//| running minimum is not, so the deals are sorted (DEAL_TIME,      |
//| DEAL_TICKET) ascending per design item 1's tiebreak before the   |
//| fold; ticket assignment reflects true broker-side sequencing     |
//| when wall-clock seconds tie, and an intra-second dip is exactly  |
//| the case where transient ordering changes whether it is visible. |
//| MQL5 does not document HistoryDealGetTicket's order, so it is    |
//| established here rather than assumed. Insertion sort is O(n^2)   |
//| and deliberate: this runs at boot only, never per tick, and n is |
//| one day's deals on one account.                                  |
//|                                                                  |
//| Failure discipline is unchanged from Phase 1 (F6): a false       |
//| HistorySelect is a stability failure, never zero deals.          |
//|                                                                  |
//| VERSION 1 OF THE REALIZED PEAK TRAILING FLOOR (D1.1, D1.3 FINAL  |
//| 2026-08-24) ADDS running_max TO THIS SAME WALK. It is P_n, the   |
//| mirror of M_n: P_0 = 0 and P_k = max(P_{k-1}, R_k), monotonically|
//| non-decreasing. Only closed deals move it, which is D1.1 exactly:|
//| this fold sees the F12 whitelist of closures and nothing else, so|
//| floating profit cannot reach it by any path. It resets by the    |
//| WINDOW MOVING and never by an action: when the anchor advances,  |
//| the walk starts again from R_0 = 0 and P_0 = 0 by construction   |
//| (D3.2, whose Reason states it in exactly those terms).           |
//| max_ticket and max_time name the deal that last raised P_k and   |
//| are what the `realized peak raised` journal line reports; both   |
//| stay 0 while the running maximum has never left 0.               |
//|                                                                  |
//| NO SECOND WALK EXISTS TO ADD. The running maximum comes out of   |
//| the SAME sorted fold that already produces the running minimum,  |
//| which is what keeps the defect 3 shape 1 FINAL of 2026-08-20     |
//| satisfied in letter: AgRealizedFold below keeps its frozen       |
//| signature and its two outputs and is now a forwarder onto this.  |
//|                                                                  |
//| The rise test here is a plain >, deliberately, and the epsilon   |
//| band belongs one level up in AgPeakUpdate. Both operands here    |
//| are doubles produced by this same fold in this same pass, so no  |
//| round trip through storage exists for an exact comparison to     |
//| trip on; the persisted peak, which HAS been through              |
//| DoubleToString and back, is compared under AG_PNL_EPSILON where  |
//| it is read. That is the split the ratchet epsilon FINAL of       |
//| 2026-08-18 draws, and it is why running_min beside it is a plain |
//| < and always has been.                                           |
//|                                                                  |

//| and PK-10(a) of 2026-09-28, and the build rulings of the same    |
//| date). This same walk reads DEAL_MAGIC once per deal and reports |
//| the latest deal carrying AG_SWEEP_MAGIC, its DEAL_TIME in        |
//| sweep_time and its ticket in sweep_ticket, both 0 when today has |
//| none. Every close the sweep sends carries that magic, is sent    |
//| only while LOCKED, and is a BUY or SELL deal inside the F12      |
//| whitelist, so it is already in this walk; the boot derivation    |
//| reads it as server side evidence of a lock today. The deals are  |
//| sorted, so the last match in the fold is the latest by           |
//| (DEAL_TIME, DEAL_TICKET). NO SECOND WALK AND NO FURTHER HISTORY  |
