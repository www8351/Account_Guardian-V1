//| state counter (A3), which must advance in a dead market.         |
//| No trade calls in this file (static-structure rule, SPEC 1).     |

//| forward jump of more than one day sets the jump note, naming     |
//| both anchors for the caller to announce loudly, and then         |
//| ACCEPTS fresh and advances the high mark, so the pass proceeds    |

//| three days at the Monday reopen (Friday 01:00 is held through    |
//| the freeze, plan 2.3), so the original rule stalled evaluation   |
//| permanently on every weekend-spanning session. A guardian that   |
